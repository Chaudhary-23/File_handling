        "**Q2- What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "Ans- Exception handling in Python is a way to gracefully handle errors that might occur during your program's execution, without crashing the whole thing.\n",
        "\n",
        "An exception is a runtime error — something unexpected that disrupts normal flow. For example:\n",
        "x = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",

        "Ans- Using logging in a program has several key advantages—especially as our codebase grows or moves into production. Here’s why logging is a smart and scalable alternative to using print():\n",
        "1. Helps with Debugging and Monitoring\n",
        "Logs give you a history of what your program did and when.\n",
        "You can trace issues even after the program has run, unlike print() which disappears unless redirected.\n",
        "2. Provides Different Log Levels\n",
        "Built-in support for different levels of importance:\n",
        "DEBUG – Detailed info (for debugging)\n",
        "INFO – General events (e.g., \"App started\")\n",
        "WARNING – Something unexpected, but not fatal\n",
        "ERROR – A serious issue occurred\n",
        "CRITICAL – Very serious error (e.g., crash)\n",
        "You can filter logs based on severity.\n",
        "3. Easy to Redirect Output\n",
        "Log to files, streams, remote servers, or even email/SMS if needed.\n",
        "Example: log errors to a file while still showing warnings on the console.\n",
        "4. Thread-safe and Multiprocess-friendly\n",
        "Python’s logging module is designed to work well in multi-threaded or multi-process programs.\n",
        "Prevents log overlap and keeps records clean and organized.\n",
        "5. Flexible Formatting and Structure\n",
        "Add timestamps, line numbers, module names, etc.\n",
        "Format logs to be machine-readable (like JSON), which is useful for log aggregators (e.g., ELK, Datadog).\n",
        "6. Easier Maintenance\n",
        "Logs help developers understand user behavior, track bugs, and audit events over time.\n",
        "Makes bug reports more useful and easier to reproduce.\n",

        "**Q11- What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "Ans- Memory management in Python is the process of handling the allocation, use, and release of memory during a program’s execution. Python automates most of this to make coding easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Concepts in Python's Memory Management:\n",
        "1. Automatic Memory Allocation\n",
        "When you create variables, objects, or data structures, Python automatically allocates memory to store them.\n",
        "This is done through Python’s memory manager, which is part of the interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Reference Counting\n",
        "Every object in Python has a reference count — the number of variables or data structures that refer to it.\n",
        "When the reference count drops to zero, the memory is automatically freed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Garbage Collection\n",
        "Python also includes a garbage collector to clean up objects involved in reference cycles (where two or more objects reference each other, preventing their reference counts from ever reaching zero).\n",
        "The gc module allows manual interaction with the garbage collector if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "import gc\n",
        "gc.collect()  # Manually triggers garbage collection\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Private Heap Space\n",
        "All Python objects and variables are stored in a private heap — a chunk of memory reserved for the Python interpreter.\n",
        "Programmers don't access it directly; the interpreter handles it automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Memory Pools (PyMalloc)\n",
        "For efficiency, Python uses an internal memory allocator called PyMalloc for managing small objects.\n",
        "It reduces fragmentation and improves performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of Python’s Memory Management\n",
        "Simplicity: Developers don’t need to manually manage memory (unlike C/C++).\n",
        "Safety: Fewer chances of memory leaks or segmentation faults.\n",
        "Efficiency: Built-in tools like PyMalloc and garbage collection keep things optimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q12- What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "Ans- Exception handling in Python is all about managing errors gracefully so your program doesn’t crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the basic steps involved in handling exceptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Try Block: Code That Might Fail\n",
        "Wrap the risky code inside a try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = 10 / 0\n",
        "Python will attempt to run this code, and if an exception occurs, it jumps to the matching except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Except Block: Handle the Error\n",
        "Catch and handle specific exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also handle multiple or generic exceptions:\n",
        "except (ValueError, TypeError):\n",
        "    print(\"Caught a ValueError or TypeError\")\n",
        "\n",
        "except Exception as e:\n",
        "    print(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Else Block (Optional)\n",
        "Runs only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"No errors, everything went smoothly!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Finally Block (Optional)\n",
        "Runs no matter what—whether an exception occurred or not. Great for cleanup tasks like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "finally:\n",
        "    print(\"This always runs, error or not.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q13- Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "Ans- Memory management is super important in Python—just like in any programming language—because it helps ensure your program runs efficiently, doesn't crash, and doesn't use more memory than it needs.\n",
        "Here’s why it really matters:\n",
        "1. Prevents Memory Leaks\n",
        "If your program keeps allocating memory and never frees it (e.g., due to circular references or holding onto unused objects), it can lead to a memory leak.This slows down your app, eats up system resources, and can eventually cause crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Improves Performance\n",
        "Efficient memory usage = faster programs.\n",
        "Python’s automatic memory management (like garbage collection) helps manage memory without manual effort, but understanding it lets you write more optimized code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Avoids Program Crashes\n",
        "Improper memory handling (like holding huge lists in memory unnecessarily) can cause the program to crash or raise MemoryError.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Supports Scalability\n",
        "If your Python app grows (e.g., a web service handling many users), poor memory handling can limit its scalability.\n",
        "Good memory practices make it easier to scale up without hitting memory ceilings.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Ensures Cleaner Code\n",
        "Understanding Python’s memory management encourages the use of good practices like:\n",
        "with statements for file and resource handling\n",
        "Deleting references (del) when objects are no longer needed\n",
        "Avoiding unnecessary global variables\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q14- What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n",
        "Ans- The try and except blocks in Python are core components of exception handling. They let you write code that can catch and handle errors gracefully instead of crashing the entire program.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 try: The Risky Code\n",
        "The try block contains code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = 10 / 0\n",
        "\n",
        "Python will attempt to run this block.\n",
        "If no error happens, it skips the except block.\n",
        "If an error does occur, it immediately jumps to the matching except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 except: The Rescue Block\n",
        "The except block defines how to handle specific exceptions.\n",

        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Catches and handles the ZeroDivisionError raised in the try block.\n",
        "You can have multiple except blocks for different exception types.\n",
        "You can also use a generic except Exception as e to catch any exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / num\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q15- How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "Ans- Python’s garbage collection system is designed to automatically manage memory—freeing up space by removing objects that are no longer needed. This helps keep your programs efficient and prevents memory leaks.\n",
        "How It Works: The Core Mechanisms\n",
        "1. Reference Counting\n",
        "Every object in Python keeps track of how many references point to it.\n",
        "When the reference count drops to zero, Python automatically deallocates the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "import sys\n",
        "a = []\n",
        "print(sys.getrefcount(a))  # Shows how many references point to 'a'\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Garbage Collector for Cyclic References\n",
        "Reference counting alone can’t handle cyclic references (e.g., object A references B and B references A).\n",
        "So Python has a cyclic garbage collector that:\n",
        "Scans for groups of objects referencing each other.\n",
        "Removes them if they're not accessible from outside the cycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "import gc\n",
        "gc.collect()  # Manually triggers garbage collection\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Python’s GC is Divided into Generations\n",
        "Python's gc module divides objects into three generations (0, 1, 2):\n",
        "Gen 0: New objects. Collected most frequently.\n",
        "Gen 1 & 2: Older, long-lived objects. Collected less often.\n",
        "Why? Because most objects die young—so collecting Gen 0 often saves time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q16- What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n",
        "Ans- The else block in Python exception handling is a lesser-known but super useful feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of the else Block\n",
        "The else block is used to define a section of code that should run only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Basic Flow:\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # Risky code that might raise an exception\n",
        "except SomeError:\n",
        "    # Runs if an exception occurs\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    # Runs *only* if no exception was raised\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Use else?\n",
        "To separate normal logic from error handling.\n",
        "Keeps your code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "Avoids accidentally running code inside the try block that doesn’t need to be there.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"That's not a valid number.\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(f\"You entered: {number}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "What happens here:\n",

        "Ans- Closing a file in Python is crucial for proper file handling and system resource management. When you're done reading from or writing to a file, you should always close it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s why it’s important:\n",
        "1. Frees Up System Resources\n",
        "Files take up resources like file handles, which are limited.\n",
        "If too many files are left open, your program or system might hit a resource limit and fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Flushes Data to Disk\n",
        "When you write to a file, data is often stored in a buffer temporarily.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Prevents File Corruption\n",
        "Especially in write mode, leaving a file open without closing it can cause incomplete writes or corrupted files.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Allows Other Programs to Access the File\n",
        "Some systems lock a file while it's open.\n",

        "Ans- The logging module in Python is used to track events that happen when your program runs — especially errors, warnings, and informational messages. It’s a powerful alternative to using print(), and it helps in debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Main Purpose of the logging Module:\n",
        "To record messages that describe the flow of your program or issues that occur.\n",
        "To make it easy to log messages at different severity levels (e.g., info, warning, error).\n",

        "**Q23- What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "Ans- While Python handles most memory management automatically, there are still several challenges and pitfalls developers should be aware of.\n",
        "Here’s a breakdown of the key challenges associated with memory management in Python 👇\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Memory Leaks\n",
        "Even though Python uses automatic garbage collection, memory leaks can still occur—especially when:\n",
        "Objects reference each other (circular references) and aren't collected.\n",
        "Objects are unintentionally kept alive by global variables, caches, or long-lived containers (like lists or dicts).\n",
        "\n",
        "leaky_list = []\n",
        "for i in range(100000):\n",
        "    leaky_list.append(lambda: i)  # Keeps 'i' in memory\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Circular References\n",
        "Python's reference counting system can't clean up circular references by itself.\n",
        "It relies on the cyclic garbage collector, which may not run immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.ref = self\n",
        "\n",
        "a = A()  # a -> a.ref -> a (cycle)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. High Memory Consumption\n",
        "Python objects have more overhead than primitive data types in lower-level languages like C.\n",
        "Programs that handle large datasets or high-frequency loops can consume more memory than expected.\n",
        "Tools like numpy help reduce this by using memory-efficient arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Delayed Garbage Collection\n",
        "Just because an object is no longer needed doesn't mean it gets deleted immediately.\n",
        "This delay can cause memory spikes in performance-critical applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Poor Use of Data Structures\n",
        "Using the wrong data structure (e.g., list vs set vs dict) can lead to unnecessary memory use.\n",
        "Mutable default arguments in functions can also cause unexpected memory retention.\n",
        "\n",
        "def append_to_list(value, my_list=[]):  # Bad!\n",
        "    my_list.append(value)\n",
        "    return my_list\n",
        "\n",
        "6. External Libraries and Extensions\n",
        "Some third-party C extensions (or Cython code) may not release memory properly.\n",
        "Memory management issues in these libraries are harder to debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24- How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "Ans- In Python, you can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword. This is useful when you want to signal an error condition intentionally in your code — like when a function receives invalid input.\n",
        "\n",
        "raise ExceptionType(\"Optional error message\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "ExceptionType is any built-in or custom exception class (e.g., ValueError, TypeError, RuntimeError, etc.)\n",
        "The string in parentheses is the error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples\n",
        "Raising a built-in exception:\n",
        "raise ValueError(\"Invalid input provided\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In a function:\n",
        "def divide(a, b):\n",
        "    if b == 0:\n",
        "        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
        "    return a / b\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Raising a custom exception:\n",
        "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "raise MyCustomError(\"Something custom went wrong!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Why raise exceptions?\n",
        "To enforce rules in your code (like argument checks)\n",
        "To make your application more predictable and debuggable\n",
        "To provide clear feedback when something goes wrong\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25- Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "Ans- Using multithreading in certain applications is important because it helps make programs more responsive, efficient, and capable of doing multiple tasks at once—especially in situations where you're waiting on I/O operations (like files, network, or user input).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a breakdown of why and when multithreading matters:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improved Responsiveness\n",
        "Multithreading allows an app to remain responsive to users while doing background tasks.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "In a GUI app, one thread can update the interface while another downloads data from the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Efficient I/O Handling\n",
        "Python threads are great for I/O-bound tasks like:\n",
        "Reading/writing files\n",
        "Making API calls\n",
        "Waiting for user input\n",
        "Accessing databases\n",
        "Because I/O operations spend time waiting, the thread can yield control and let other threads run.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Concurrent Task Execution\n",
        "Threads allow concurrent execution—so one thread doesn’t block others.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A chatbot thread listens for messages while another one sends notifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Better Resource Utilization\n",
        "Multithreading can help you get more done with the same CPU by:\n",
        "Reducing idle time\n",
        "Utilizing waiting periods of one thread to run another\n",
        "\n",
        "When not to use it:\n",
        "For CPU-bound tasks, Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can become a bottleneck because only one thread runs Python bytecode at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "In that case, use the multiprocessing module instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario - Benefit\n",
        "File download/upload - Handles multiple transfers at once\n",
        "Real-time data streaming - Read/process concurrently\n",
        "Chatbots or messaging apps - Handle multiple conversations\n",
        "Web scraping with many requests - Send concurrent HTTP requests\n",
        "GUI applications - Keeps UI responsive"
